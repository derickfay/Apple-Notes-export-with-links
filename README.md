# Apple Notes export with links
Export from Apple Notes on macOS and iOS while preserving URLs 

Update (2019-06-04): Copying from Notes and pasting in Ulysses keeps embedded links now (on Mojave) so the MacOS part of this is no longer necessary.

I had created a long Apple note with a bunch of embedded links.  So many in fact that I wanted to break the document up into a bunch of sub-documents.  I figured I would just copy and paste into Ulysses, and split there.  No luck: the text that was pasted came in as plain text, with just the titles of the links and no URLs.  On both macOS and iOS.

I looked around in Notes' AppleScript but the URLs for my links didn't appear in the html source for the note or in any of the attachments (at least not in a way that was exposed to AppleScript).

After some trial and error, I realized that, in macOS, if I copied and pasted into an rtf document (in TextEdit or Nisus), the links would remain active. So I wrote this AppleScript (which relies on a bunch of simulated keyboard presses) to copy the active note to a new document in TextEdit.  The resulting document can be saved and dragged into Ulysses, and Ulysses will convert the rtf to Markdown.

This didn't work in iOS, at least not with the only rich text editors I had, Scrivener and Word. Fortunately I had just been catching up on the Canvas podcast and remembered the recommendation to use the content graph and quick look to see what a share sheet was outputting.  Alas, it was plain text. But when I selected text in Notes and copied it, rather than using the share sheet or the share popup on a selection, it was rich text. From there it was a matter of piping it out to Workflow's *make Markdown from rich text* action, then back to the clipboard.
